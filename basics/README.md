# Main.java
this is the simple printing program. A class name first letter must be capital.

# Variables.java
JAVA is a statically tyoed -> Variable must be declared before its use.

here datatypes and variable is demonstrated
1. Rules for naming a Variables
-> Must not begin with a digit
-> Name is case sensetive
-> Should not be a key word.
-> White space is not allowd. (int code with sujan X )
-> Can contain alphabets, numbers, characters if the other conditions are met

# DataTypes.java
1. byte -> value ranges form -128 to 127
        -> takes 1 byte
        -> default value 0

to know the value range you dont have to memorise you are not a harddisk, so what you can do is raise the power of 2 to the bits it take and divide it by 2 and subtract the later one by 1.
Eg : 2<sup>8</sup>/2 to 2<sup>8</sup>/2 -1   => cause 1 byte has 8bits.

2. short -> value ranges form
